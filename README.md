# ORDERS MANAGER
**Author: Cezary Petryka**

**It is a program for managing orders for selected products.**

**Most of the Java key concepts are used in the programme. Some of them are:**
- OOP
- Creating one's own enums
- Creating one's own exceptions
- Interfaces and generic types
- Sealed classes
- Files management
- Regular expressions
- Collections
- Streams

**Requirements:**
- The programme ensures accurate storage of product prices (BigDecimal class used)
- Sample orders data is retrieved from a file, validated and parsed.
- A number of methods have been implemented in the OrderService class, allowing the collection of orders to be managed easily:
  - finding orders that meet a specific condition
  - finding the cheapest and most expensive orders
  - determining the average price of orders and the average and maximum value of discounts granted 
  - determining various product and category statistics
